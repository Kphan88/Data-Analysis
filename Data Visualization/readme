The practical use of this dataset is to help describe flight delays. To identify this, we will focus on arrival delays (as opposed to departure delays) as they are more impactful to a customer's plans and possible flight connections. To identify a flight as delayed, we will use the industry standard of a flight arriving 15 minutes or later than it's scheduled arrival time is determined to be "delayed" (why is the industry standard not more than 0 minutes after it's scheduled arrival time...good question). A good prediction algorithm would be able to predict the likelihood that a flight was delayed depending on the airline and route.
