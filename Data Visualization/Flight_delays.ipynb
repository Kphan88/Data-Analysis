    "The purpose of this dataset is to describe the operational performance of domestic U.S. airlines flights in terms of delays and cancellations. The data collected describes flights during 2015, flown by the operating carrier. The operating carrier is indicated by the International Air Transport Association, or IATA, two letter carrier code. These codes are less recognizable than the common brand names, so we will provide a table detailing which code relates to which airline brand in the \"Data Meaning Type\" section. The distinction between \"operating\" and \"marketing\" carrier is an important one in the airline industry, but that will be discussed in more detail in the \"Data Quality\" section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The practical use of this dataset is to help describe flight delays. To identify this, we will focus on arrival delays (as opposed to departure delays) as they are more impactful to a customer's plans and possible flight connections. To identify a flight as delayed, we will use the industry standard of a flight arriving 15 minutes or later than it's scheduled arrival time is determined to be \"delayed\" (why is the industry standard not more than 0 minutes after it's scheduled arrival time...good question). A good prediction algorithm would be able to predict the likelihood that a flight was delayed depending on the airline and route. "

    "### Data Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in an earlier section, the data collected describes flights during 2015. One thing to note is that due to US Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations, any airline with at least one percent of total domestic scheduled-service passenger revenues must report on-time data. This means that while all of the major airlines are covered in this data set, it does not describe all of the domestic air travel performance during 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the data is reported in terms of operating carrier. A common practice, especially among larger air carriers, is to supplement their service and route network by leasing air service from smaller carriers who have smaller aircraft better suited to serving less populous cities. This means that there is a small difference between between the operational performance this data describes and how a consumer may think of an airline's operational performace. An example will help illustrate the point.\n",
    "\n",
    "SkyWest Airlines (carrier code \"OO\") partners with United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, and Alaska Airlines to provide leased air service under each of those various larger carriers' brands. Additionally, smaller, lease focused carriers like SkyWest will sometimes fly under their own brand. So in the dataset used in this project a delayed flight may have a carrier code of \"OO\", which identifies that it was a SkyWest flight, even though it was flown under United Airlines brand, and the customers who flew on that flight had purchased a United Airlines ticket. The dataset uses the IATA (International Air Transport Association) code to identify the unique airlines. While this makes sense for an industry dataset, it may not be immediately intuitive for most consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, as a result of how regulated the airline industry is, the reporting of this data is highly structured and mandated by the DOT. Additionally, because this information must be reported regularly and in a timely basis, the collection of the data is automated in most cases. The end result is that the data set has fewer occurences of erroneous responses, or missing responses than many others. There are a few cases where the airport is not known. Because of the variation depending on many different factors, we did not feel that imputing a value, or erroneously assigning an airport to that record, made sense. We have left these as blank. One of the few concerns with the data is that several fields in the set are only triggered if a delay occurs. For flights in which a delay did not occur, the field is left \"blank\". For the purposes of analysis, this is the equivalent of a zero minute delay. The fields in which this is a concern are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Cancellation_reason\n",
    " - Air_system_delay\n",
    " - Security_delay\n",
    " - Airline_delay\n",
    " - Late_aircraft_delay\n",
    " - Weather_delay\n",

    "To clean the data we will replace all blank values with a 0."

    "The final concern with the data is not related to the quality, but rather the size. In its raw form the dataset has 5,819,079 records and 31 columns. While such a dataset is not so large that it could not be used, it is too large to post on our GitHub repository.  Therefore, we decided to focus on a subset of airports to make the visualizations easier to extract meaning from, and to ease the computational burden. The airports we chose to focus on were:\n",

    "These airports represented several advatages as a subset. One is that they easy represent a different region of the country (West, Central, East). Another is that they are large airport with many daily flights from all over the country. This means that our data subset will have a sample of flights from many regions. Finally, this subset of airports is served by a wide range of airlines. United Airlines has a \"hub\" operation (a large number of flights going in and out of the same airport timed such that the flights can \"feed\" each other) at SFO. Southwest Airlines, while not techincally a hub carrier, has a significant operation at MDW. And just about all major US airlines have significant operations to and from LGA as it is one of the main airports serving New York city."

    "Before interpreting the simple statistics it is important to note (once again) that our data has been subsetted to only include flights that had an arrival delay of greater than 15 minutes. So if we were to look at the mean delay of flights from our three airports (60.78 minutes), it is not the average delay of all flights from these airports. That would be much lower due to flights that weren't delayed or arrived early.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that said, one interesting, although not surprising, aspect of the statistics is how closely tied mean departure delay and arrival delay are. The mean departure delay was 57.86 minutes while the mean arrival delay was 60.78 minutes. While there are many variables at play, this is a bit of a surprising result. Once a flight's departure is delayed there are some limited options in the pilot's control to \"make up\" for the delay in the air. One is to simply fly more quickly. This is not done as standard practice as it burns more fuel (and the planes do not always have significant amounts of spare fuel loaded, in fact in practice they want as little fuel loaded onto the plane as is possible without compromising safety and more fuel makes the plane heavier, and therefore less fuel efficient, and therefore more expensive to operate), and for other reasons which are beyond the scope of this analysis to detail here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another aspect of the summary statistics that jumps out is mean delay attributed to a late arriving aircraft. The mean delay is 28.85 minutes, which is by far the longest mean delay among the possible causes. The next closest is \"airline delay\" at 18.04 minutes. We believe that the most likely explanation for this large gap is that our subset of airports are very busy airports. That results in congested air space which can cause arrival delays due to air traffic as even a large airport's supply of runways can be outpaced by the \"demand\" for landings during peak periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Far and away the shortest mean cause of delays was security, at 0.04 minutes. Perhaps anyone who has gone through security at these airports might disagree with the accounting of delay causes?"

Of note is that “AIR_SYSTEM_DELAY” is rarely a cause of delays. Weather and late aircraft are common, but airline delays are the biggest driver of delayed arrivals. Airline delays can be caused by a variety of factors including mechanical issues, crew “timing out”. That is, per Federal Aviation Administration regulations, pilots must get a minimum of ten hours rest between shifts, and eight of those hours must involve uninterrupted sleep.  Additionally, they can only must have 30 hours of consecutive rest each week. What this means is that a crew could be scheduled to flight an additional flight, but due to delays earlier in their trip, they could “time-out”, which means they are not legal to fly the next trip. In which case the airline must scramble to find fresh pilots, which can cause delays.\n"

    "The raw dataset is very large and reported at a granular level. As such there are significant differences between the different airports, time of day, etc. One way to gain more information, as well as making the data set easier to handle, would be to group variables in a logical manner:\n",
    "\n",
    " - A field that shows the geographic region of the origin and destination airports (the idea being that some regions of the country are more likely to have weather that is difficult to operate in, and therefore more likely to have delayed flights\n",
    " - A variable which groups flights into short haul, medium haul and long haul (0-500 miles, 501-1000 miles, and 1001 miles as a starting suggestion). This has the benefit of allowing to do some feature reduction without completely losing the length of haul information provided by the distance field)\n",
    " - A field grouping the scheduled departure time (morning, afternoon, evening, late evening, red-eye). Like with the distance grouping, it allows for some feature reduction while not losing all of the information provided by the scheduled departure time. Also, the later in the day a flightis the more likely it is to have a late arriving aircraft of some other issue that causes a delay. Also, many airlines \"bank\" their flights, which means that they have many departing around the same time so that they can connect passengers. But this causes airport congestion which can lead to delays.\n",
    " \n",
    "This has the potential of helping us in two ways. One, as mentioned, is to allow us to aggregate observations in a logical way to pick out trends that can be generalized. As an example, knowing that a flight to White Plains, New York (airport code: HPN) is not likely to be useful to many people. However, knowing that flights to the northeast, especially during winters, are more likely to be delayed when coming from the Midwest, would be useful information for a large number of people.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second benefit is that it could serve as data reduction. Rather than predicting how flights perform between all the different permutations of airports across the country, predicting how they perform between a handful of different regions would be much cheaper computationally. \n",

    "Two things jump out about this data. The first is that all regions have similar delay rates. The second, is that while it is not a huge difference, the Northeast (NE) does have a higher delay rate than any other region.\n",
    "\n",

Another likely contributing factor is weather. Cold weather can result in delays to wait for storms to pass or because planes have to go through a \"de-icing\" process.\n",
